# Trivy Scan Results

This folder contains the results of a security scan performed on the `todo-my-todo-list` Kubernetes deployment using **Trivy**.

## Files

### 1. `summary.txt`
- Provides a high-level summary of the scan results
- Key insights:
  - **Total Tests**: 100
  - **Successes**: 94
  - **Failures**: 6
  - **Severity**: All failures are classified as `LOW`

### 2. `detailed.json`
- Contains a detailed breakdown of the scan results.
- Includes:
  - Specific misconfigurations identified
  - Suggested resolutions
  - Links to relevant documentation for each finding

### 3. `dryrun.yaml`
- The input Kubernetes manifest used during the Trivy scan
- Represents the Helm template output of the deployment

## Key Findings
- **Resource Limits and Requests**: Missing CPU and memory limits/requests can lead to resource contention or overconsumption
- **Security Context**:
  - `runAsUser` and `runAsGroup` values should be set to IDs greater than 10,000 for better isolation
  - Ensure containers do not run with privileged permissions

Refer to the `detailed.json` file for a comprehensive view of each finding and its recommended resolution.

## Next Steps
1. Address the identified misconfigurations in the Kubernetes manifests
2. Re-scan the deployment after making adjustments to ensure compliance with security best practices
