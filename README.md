# Bob's Kubernetes Journey

Welcome to **Bob's Kubernetes Journey**, a collection of resources, examples, and projects accompanying the [article series](https://kelcode.co.uk/tag/bobsjourney/). Whether you're learning Kubernetes, Helm, or other related technologies, this repository is here to guide you step by step.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

The code in this repository is for **educational purposes only** and is **not secure** in its current form. It demonstrates concepts like secure containerisation and Kubernetes deployments but:
- **Does not implement proper input validation.**
- **Lacks authentication and authorisation mechanisms.**
- **Is vulnerable to attacks like injection and XSS.**

Do not use this code in production environments without significant modifications to address these security concerns.

## 📖 About

This repository is designed to provide:
- Practical examples from each article in the series.
- Standalone projects to dive deeper into specific topics like Helm, Secrets, ConfigMaps, and more.
- Reusable configurations and templates to kickstart your Kubernetes projects.

Each folder corresponds to an article in the series and includes all the code and configuration files discussed in that article.
